Some remarks if someone comes across this translation :

- "Shield generator" has been (litteraly) translated to "Energy field generator", as translating directly to the 
french word "générateur de bouclier" (shield generator) would sound weird. French people would be more familiar with the notion
of energy field, which ACTS AS a shield but is not a shield...Let's hope I'm clear

- breakdown has no equivalent in french, so it was translated depending on context, provided the meaning of something broken 
was conveyed

- The specific word "Heatsink" translates to "radiateur" in french, which is a more global word to describe something that dissipates
heat in order to heat something, not to take the heat away from something, unless used in a specific domain (like computers)
Therefore, I made sure that in the tutor, descriptions etc, it was clear that we are talking about a heatsink

- Similarly, "Heat" is another technical word in english, but translates in a layman's word (chaleur) in french, so I translated it
into "thermal energy" which has the same scientific sounding than "heat" has in english

- "coil" in the contrary, seems to be a common word in english, while its french translation is more technical ("bobine inductive")
I changed the entire word, it is now an "absorption/absorbing circuit"

- "tile" was tricky, I could not find the french equivalent. I translated it into "carré" (square)

- "Failure" translates into the over-sophisticated word "dysfonctionnement". I put "danger" instead, so minor, major and critical 
possible failures become minor, major and critical dangers created by overheating

- The embedded "nuclear generator" in the portable shield generator was translated to "pile atomique" (the name given to the first 
nuclear generators) instead of "centrale nucléaire" (nuclear power plant) or "générateur nucléaire". 
French people would find weird that an entire nuclear power plant is in that tiny object. And "générateur nucleaire" isn't french.
"pile atomique" however conveys very well the notion of a miniaturized nuclear generator

That's it !
Have fun
